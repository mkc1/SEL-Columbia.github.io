      The Millennium Development Goals aim to halve the percentage of the population without access to safe drinking water. Considerable progress has been made, but 24/7 availability remains a challenge and maintenance is hampered by traditional means of revenue collection and transaction costs. Quench offers an improved water management solution that can increase access and provide more reliable service.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>Robust Construction</strong><br />Quench lowers maintenance costs with a rugged, modular design. Parts are easily replaced, and during repair, the system can be manually operated, allowing for continued water access.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <strong>Simple To Use</strong><br />Quench kiosks are easy and intuitive, lowering confusion and minimizing transaction times. Installing Quench is simple and flexible as the kiosk can replace existing water systems or be implemented alongside current designs, whether grid power is available or not.
    </p>
    
    <strong>Enables Fair Distribution</strong><br /> Quench enables accurate daily water metering and dispensing, storing allotments and transactions in a smart card system. This allows operators to allocate daily lifeline amounts to families and ensure equitable water distribution based on seasonal availability.</p>
