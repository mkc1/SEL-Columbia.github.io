<h3>Nigeria MDGs Information System</h3>
<p>NMIS visualizes data for schools, health clinics, and water pionts to facilitate data-driven planning across hundreds of Local Government Areas in Nigeria. Local planning and centralized review of local plans are facilitated by data about geo-located social infrastructure in a common map-based platform, and geographical visualizations and aggregations by geopolitical entities.</p>
