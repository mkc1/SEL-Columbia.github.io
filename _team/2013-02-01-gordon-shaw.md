Shortly after Gordon received a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering from The University of Toledo, he joined the Peace Corps as a Math and Physics teacher in Rwanda. This experience gave him the travel bug and really opened his eyes to the meaningful opportunities available in developing countries for Engineers. He completed his M.S. in Mechanical Engineering with a concentration in Energy Systems under the direction of Prof. Modi in 2014. Since that time, he has worked as a Project Manager for the SharedSolar and Acacia Irrigation projects in Uganda and Senegal. He is fascinated by traveling to new places and meeting new people, and he is willing to try almost any food/drink that is presented to him.
